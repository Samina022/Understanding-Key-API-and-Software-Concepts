# Understanding-Key-API-and-Software-Concepts
**API** (Application Programming Interface): An API allows different software applications to communicate with each other by defining methods and data formats for requesting and exchanging information.

**SDK**(Software Development Kit): An SDK is a collection of tools, libraries, and documentation that helps developers build applications for specific platforms or services.

**Web APIs:** Web APIs enable communication between different systems over the internet using HTTP protocols, often in formats like JSON or XML.

**Library APIs:** Library APIs provide a set of pre-defined functions or routines for developers to use in their applications, allowing access to a specific functionality or service without needing to write code from scratch.

**Prompting and Completion:** Prompting refers to providing input to a language model to generate a response, while completion is the output generated by the model based on that input.
